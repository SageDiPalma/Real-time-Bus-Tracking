## Real Time Bus Tracking

The purpose of this project is to fetch data from an API and use it to animate a map.
In this project, i use the real-time geolocation of MBTA, it will refreshed every 15 seconds and each bus will have a marker also ID

In the Real Time Bus Tracker exercise, I use an asynchronous code and the DOM to animate maps, leveraging the Mapbox program. Asynchronous operations occur outside the program's main loop, like a timer in an event loop, where callbacks handle operations like file writing or database access. This exercise combines skills in handling maps, timers, and dynamic data tracking, using real-time information from the MBTA or other cities' shared data.
